# Hello

My name is Andy Howlett, an artist and filmmaker based in Birmingham, UK. I'm interested in walking, concrete, guerrilla heritage and expanded cinema. Here are some of my [films](https://vimeo.com/channels/andyhowlett).

## Stuff I'm doing

- [Paradise Lost: History in the Un-Making](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/paradise-lost-history-in-the-un-making-architecture) - A feature length essay-film investigating the untimely demise of John Madin's brutalist Central Library. Successfully crowdfunded in 2016, to be released one day.

- [The Magic Cinema](https://en-gb.facebook.com/themagiccinema/)  - A DIY film night with "open reel" policy - bring along a short film and we'll show it (no actual reel involved). The Magic Cinema also provides a testing ground for more experimental material that brings live/performance elements into the cinematic setting. The Magic Cinema is currently hibernating but will return soon...

- [Video Strolls](http://videostrolls.com) - A Community of artists and filmmakers who make work concerned with place, people and journeying. We host regular public screenings and have worked with festivals such as Flatpack Film Festival and Alchemy.

- [Cross City Walks](http://xcw.org.uk) - A walking project bisecting cities in straight lines with [Pete Ashton](http://peteashton.com/).

- Dream 53 - A psychogeographical live art project invoking the spirit of a lost Birmingham Surrealist film. Developed as part of the first [Homegrown](http://hfwas.co.uk/?page_id=3237) artist development programme in 2016. Possibly to be resurrected in some form in the future.
