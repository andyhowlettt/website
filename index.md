# Hello

I'm Andy Howlett, an artist and filmmaker based in Birmingham, UK. I'm interested in walking, concrete, guerrilla heritage and expanded cinema. Here are some of my [films](https://vimeo.com/channels/andyhowlett).

## Stuff I'm doing

- [Paradise Lost: History in the Un-Making](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/paradise-lost-history-in-the-un-making-architecture) - A feature length video-essay investigating the untimely demise of John Madin's brutalist Central Library. Successfully crowdfunded in 2016, to be released (hopefully) in 2017.

- [The Magic Cinema](https://en-gb.facebook.com/themagiccinema/)  - A DIY film night with "open reel" policy - bring along a short film and we'll show it (no actual reel involved). The Magic Cinema also provides a testing ground for more experimental material that brings live/performance elements into the cinematic setting. Building on this we're teaming up with [Home For Waifs and Strays](http://hfwas.co.uk/) for a Live Art Cinema called [IT'S ALIVE!](http://hfwas.co.uk/?p=3694)

- [Video Strolls](http://videostrolls.com) - A Community of artists and filmmakers who make work concerned with place, people and journeying. We host regular public screenings at festivals and we have a [Film of the Month](http://www.caughtbytheriver.net/category/videostrolls/) column at Caught by the River.

- [Cross City Walks](http://xcw.org.uk) - A walking project bisecting cities in straight lines with [Pete Ashton](http://peteashton.com/).

- Dream 53 - A psychogeographical live art project invoking the spirit of a lost Birmingham Surrealist film. Developed as part of the first [Homegrown](http://hfwas.co.uk/?page_id=3237) artist development programme in 2016.

- [Scalarama](https://sites.google.com/site/scalarama/) - The annual celebration of cinema for everyone, by everyone, everywhere, every September, forever. I co-ordinate the Birmingham happenings. Drop me a line if you want to get involved.
